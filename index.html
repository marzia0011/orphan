<i>Various groups use different definitions to identify orphans.
One legal definition used in the United States is a minor bereft through "death or disappearance of, 
abandonment or desertion by, or separation or loss from, both parents". In the common use, 
an orphan does not have any surviving parent to care for them.However, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF),
Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS),and other groups label any child who has lost one parent as an orphan.
In this approach, a maternal orphan is a child whose mother has died,a paternal orphan is a child whose father has died,
and a double orphan is a child/teen/infant who has lost both parents.
 This contrasts with the older use of half-orphan to describe children who had lost only one parent.</i>
